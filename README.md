# 🗑️ Waste Classification using CNN (AL & ML Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **Environmental Monitoring & Pollution Control** system that uses **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)** to classify waste images.  
The model helps in automating **waste segregation**, which is an important step towards **pollution control and recycling management**.  

Currently, this repository contains **30% of the project** implementation:
- Dataset loading
- Image preprocessing with augmentation
- CNN model architecture definition  

Training and evaluation will be implemented in the next milestone. 🚀

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset is taken from **Kaggle - Waste Classification Dataset**.  
It contains two main categories:
- **Organic Waste**
- **Recyclable Waste**

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python 🐍  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

---

## 🚀 Current Features (30% Completed)
- Loaded dataset using **ImageDataGenerator**  
-  Applied **rescaling and augmentation**  
- Defined a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model**  
-  Training & Evaluation *(To be added in Week 2)*  

---

## 📊 Next Steps
- Train the CNN on the dataset  
- Evaluate accuracy and loss  
- Save the trained model  
- Build a simple interface for testing with new images
